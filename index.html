       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>Software developer and former Pricing Analyst with Zillow Group with home pricing analytics and customer service background driven to continue education in web development while proactively looking to obtain a software engineer position in a fast-paced organization where exceptional technical skills and ability to quickly adapt to change are essential.</p>
       
       <p>For a long time, I have wanted to learn how to program but due to life’s curveballs there never seemed to be enough time. Then, COVID hit and suddenly there was all the time in the world due to companies and schools eventually  transitioning to a remote model.  I decided to make the most out of the lockdown and dove right in. While providing tours at a computer museum, I was impressed and inspired by the ability of a team working together when creating an app or a product. That inspiration gave me a new meaning in wanting to create solutions for life’s problems using code. As I looked for role models, I found that outside the entry and mid-levels, I noticed a strong lack of people who looked like me in the management, director, and C-suite levels. How can my demography be the second most in the industry but almost never in these types of positions?  I want to grow and be an example to those who look like me that we belong in these spaces. I am currently a young professional with the Year Up program where I have continued to develop hard-skills like web development, software development, and data analyzation, in addition to fostering soft-skills such as, strong communication, adaptability, and leadership. The Year Up program gives me a platform where we can practice these skills and competencies while creating a strong foundation for continued growth in not just the tech industry but in all.</p>
       
       <p>Prior to my time at Year Up, I have held various roles. Mostly working in different forms of customer service through travel companies like Greyhound and BoltBus, I found true inspiration for my future working as a tour guide at the Living Computer Museum. Interacting and talking about these older machines was beyond fascinating to me. I knew that I wanted to move away from customer service and into more technical roles which led to my most recent role as a Pricing Analyst with Zillow Group. Though I enjoyed my role, it did not give me enough sense of fulfillment. There is something inside me that needs to be fulfilled. The exploration of its source feels innate, and I want it deeply. Of course, wanting something bad enough is not good enough, and convincing others of this desire can be difficult. However, in lieu of a formal background in computer science, I draw from my experiences in my drive to become a software developer</p>
       
       <p>What drives me is my personal experience as a child of Filipino immigrants. The struggles many immigrant families face are unfortunately common, but they are nevertheless unique to the individual. What’s even more unique is the way an individual deals with these struggles. I cope with depression, experienced financial hardship such as foreclosing on our family home, and forgoed the opportunity to attend college to work. These were once considered roadblocks but now I consider them as essential building blocks for a foundation to a stronger me. They are an integral part of my strength and motivation, and I will continue to rely on them when I am tested in both the path to becoming and working as a software developer.

       </p>
           
      <p>As mentioned above, along with my immense passion for software development, I am confident that I can excel in roles as a software developer and be a proven example that many talented people who come from non-traditional backgrounds, when presented with the opportunity, can become successful in the tech industry.</p>

      <p> Ever onward,</p>
